# Lattice Decisions

> A small log of non-obvious choices so we do not relitigate them later.
> Date format: YYYY-MM-DD.

---

## 2026-02-15: Events are authoritative

- Decision: The per-task JSONL event log is the source of truth. Task JSON files are materialized snapshots.
- Rationale: Makes crash recovery and integrity checks straightforward; avoids “which file do we believe?” ambiguity.
- Consequence: We must ship `lattice rebuild` (replay events) and `lattice doctor` (integrity checks).

---

## 2026-02-15: Avoid duplicated canonical edges

- Decision: We do not store bidirectional relationship edges as canonical state.
- Rationale: Bidirectional storage forces multi-file transactional updates and creates split-brain inconsistencies under concurrency.
- Consequence: Reverse lookups are derived by scanning snapshots in v0 and via an index in v1+.

---

## 2026-02-15: Artifacts are not archived in v0

- Decision: Archiving moves tasks/events/notes only. Artifacts stay in place.
- Rationale: Artifacts can relate to many tasks; moving them introduces complex relocation rules and broken references.
- Consequence: Archived tasks remain able to reference artifacts by ID.

---

## 2026-02-15: Idempotency via caller-supplied IDs

- Decision: CLI supports `--id` for task/artifact/event creation so agents can safely retry operations.
- Rationale: ULIDs generated at write-time are not deterministic across retries.
- Consequence: Agents should generate IDs once and reuse them; CLI treats existing IDs as upserts.

---

## 2026-02-15: Lock + atomic write is required, even for JSONL

- Decision: All writes (snapshot rewrites and JSONL appends) are lock-protected and atomic.
- Rationale: Concurrent appends can interleave or partially write without explicit locking guarantees.
- Consequence: `.lattice/locks/` exists and multi-lock operations acquire locks in deterministic order.

---

## 2026-02-15: Dashboard served by CLI, read-only

- Decision: `lattice dashboard` runs a small local read-only server rather than a standalone static HTML that reads the filesystem directly.
- Rationale: Browsers cannot reliably read arbitrary local directories without a server or user-driven file picker flows.
- Consequence: Still no database, still no write path, still offline-friendly.

---

## 2026-02-15: Git integration is minimal in v0

- Decision: v0 only records commit references to task IDs from commit messages and logs `git_event`.
- Rationale: Diff scanning and cross-platform hook behavior can be fragile and distract from core correctness.
- Consequence: Richer `files_touched` and PR integration are v1+ only.

---

## 2026-02-15: OTel fields are passthrough metadata in v0

- Decision: Events include optional `otel` fields, but no strict tracing guarantees or exporters in v0.
- Rationale: Keeping the schema ready is cheap; enforcing full tracing discipline is expensive.
- Consequence: Adoption can ramp gradually without schema changes.

---

## 2026-02-15: Python with Click for CLI implementation

- Decision: Lattice CLI is implemented in Python 3.12+ using Click. pytest for testing. ruff for linting.
- Rationale: Fastest development velocity, agents are extremely fluent in Python, and `uv` has made Python distribution practical. Click is mature, well-documented, and agents know it well.
- Consequence: Accept ~200-500ms startup latency per invocation in v0. On-disk format is the stable contract — CLI can be rewritten in a faster language later if needed without breaking anything.

---

## 2026-02-15: Free-form actor IDs with convention, no registry

- Decision: Actor IDs are free-form strings with `prefix:identifier` format (e.g., `agent:claude-opus`, `human:atin`). No registry or validation beyond format.
- Rationale: An agent registry adds complexity with no v0 payoff. Attribution is a social/process concern, not a data integrity one.
- Consequence: Config may optionally list `known_actors` for display names, but it's not required or enforced.

---

## 2026-02-15: No dedicated notes CLI command

- Decision: Notes are directly-editable markdown files at `notes/<task_id>.md`. No `lattice note` command.
- Rationale: Agents use file tools; humans use editors. A CLI command adds ceremony without value. `lattice show` displays the note path.
- Consequence: `lattice init` creates the `notes/` directory. File creation is manual or incidental.

---

## 2026-02-15: No unarchive in v0

- Decision: `lattice archive` is one-way. No `lattice unarchive` command.
- Rationale: Archive mirrors active structure, so manual recovery (move files back) is trivial. Adding a command means testing the reverse path and edge cases around stale relationships.
- Consequence: Document manual recovery procedure. Add `unarchive` later if real pain shows up.

---

## 2026-02-15: Standard Python package for distribution

- Decision: Lattice is a standard Python package (pyproject.toml, src layout). Primary install via `uv tool install` or `pipx`. Zipapp as a bonus portability option.
- Rationale: Standard packaging supports all distribution methods without choosing exclusively. `uv` gives near-single-command install.
- Consequence: Must maintain pyproject.toml and src layout conventions.

---

## 2026-02-15: Global event log is derived, not authoritative

- Decision: `_lifecycle.jsonl` is a derived convenience index, rebuildable from per-task event logs. Per-task JSONL files are the sole authoritative record.
- Rationale: Two authoritative logs (per-task + global) creates the exact "which file do we believe?" ambiguity that event sourcing was designed to prevent.
- Consequence: `lattice rebuild` regenerates `_lifecycle.jsonl`. If the lifecycle log and per-task logs disagree, per-task logs win.

---

## 2026-02-15: Idempotency rejects conflicting payloads

- Decision: Same ID + same payload = idempotent success. Same ID + different payload = conflict error.
- Rationale: Silent upsert hides agent bugs. An agent retrying with different data likely has a logic error that should surface immediately.
- Consequence: CLI must compare incoming payload against existing entity when a duplicate ID is detected.

---

## 2026-02-15: Write ordering is event-first

- Decision: All mutations append the event before materializing the snapshot.
- Rationale: If a crash occurs between event-write and snapshot-write, `rebuild` recovers the snapshot from events. The reverse (snapshot-first) would leave orphaned state with no event record.
- Consequence: Crash semantics are well-defined: events are always at least as current as snapshots.

---

## 2026-02-15: Custom event types require x_ prefix

- Decision: `lattice event` only accepts event types prefixed with `x_` (e.g., `x_deployment_started`). Built-in type names are reserved.
- Rationale: Unbounded custom event writes would undermine schema integrity and complicate rebuild logic.
- Consequence: Built-in event types form a closed enum. Extensions use a clear namespace.

---

## 2026-02-15: Root discovery walks up from cwd

- Decision: The CLI finds `.lattice/` by walking up from the current working directory, with `LATTICE_ROOT` env var as override.
- Rationale: Mirrors `git`'s well-understood discovery model. Works naturally in monorepos and nested project structures.
- Consequence: Commands other than `lattice init` error clearly if no `.lattice/` is found.

---

## 2026-02-15: All timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC

- Decision: All timestamp fields use RFC 3339 UTC with `Z` suffix (e.g., `2026-02-15T03:45:00Z`).
- Rationale: Eliminates timezone ambiguity across agents running in different environments. RFC 3339 is a strict profile of ISO 8601.
- Consequence: No local time handling. All comparisons are UTC. ULIDs provide time-ordering; timestamps are for human readability and correlation.

---

## 2026-02-15: No config mutation events in v0

- Decision: Config changes are manual edits to `config.json`. No `lattice config` command and no `config_changed` event type in v0.
- Rationale: Config changes are rare and high-stakes. Manual editing with git tracking provides adequate auditability without additional machinery.
- Consequence: Add `lattice config set` and corresponding events in v1+ if automated config management becomes needed.

---

## 2026-02-15: Removed decisions.md from .lattice/ directory

- Decision: The `.lattice/` directory no longer includes a `decisions.md` file.
- Rationale: `.lattice/` should only contain machine-managed data. Project-level decision logs belong wherever the project keeps its documentation, not inside the Lattice runtime directory.
- Consequence: One less file to confuse with the repo-level `Decisions.md` used during Lattice development.

---

## 2026-02-15: Renamed `_global.jsonl` to `_lifecycle.jsonl`

- Decision: The derived convenience event log is now named `_lifecycle.jsonl` instead of `_global.jsonl`.
- Rationale: The log only contains lifecycle events (task_created, task_archived, task_unarchived), not "global" events. The old name implied it contained all events, which was confusing.
- Consequence: All code, tests, lock keys, and documentation updated. Variable names use `lifecycle_` prefix instead of `global_`.

---

## 2026-02-15: Renamed `lattice log` to `lattice event`

- Decision: The custom event command is now `lattice event` instead of `lattice log`.
- Rationale: `lattice log` collided with the mental model of "viewing a log" (like `git log`). The command actually records a custom event, so `event` is more descriptive.
- Consequence: ProjectRequirements_v1.md still references `lattice log` in section 13.1 — it should be updated to match.

---

## 2026-02-15: Added `lattice unarchive` (reverses earlier decision)

- Decision: `lattice unarchive` is now implemented, reversing the "No unarchive in v0" decision.
- Rationale: The implementation was straightforward (reverse the archive file moves, append a `task_unarchived` event), and the lack of unarchive was flagged during review as a usability gap. Manual file recovery is error-prone.
- Consequence: `task_unarchived` added to BUILTIN_EVENT_TYPES and LIFECYCLE_EVENT_TYPES. Archive round-trips are now fully supported.

---

## 2026-02-15: Bidirectional relationship display in `lattice show`

- Decision: `lattice show` displays both outgoing relationships (from the task's snapshot) and incoming relationships (derived by scanning all snapshots).
- Rationale: The original simplification of outgoing-only display was flagged as an oversimplification during review. Users expect to see "task B is blocked by task A" when viewing task B.
- Consequence: Canonical storage remains outgoing-only (no schema change). Incoming relationships are computed at read time by scanning `tasks/` and `archive/tasks/`. Performance is acceptable at v0 scale.

---

## 2026-02-15: Audit remediation — security, durability, and architecture

- Decision: Implemented 9 fixes from a project-wide audit covering security (path-traversal validation, POST body size limit, readonly mode for non-loopback dashboard), durability (parent-directory fsync after atomic writes), architecture (unified write-path in `lattice.storage.operations`, mutation registry pattern in `tasks.py`), and docs (requirements drift fixes, `_global.jsonl` → `_lifecycle.jsonl` alignment).
- Rationale: The audit identified gaps in input validation (path traversal via crafted task IDs), denial-of-service surface (unbounded POST bodies), data durability (missing dir fsync after rename), network safety (writes allowed on non-loopback interfaces), code duplication (CLI and dashboard had separate write paths), and documentation drift.
- Consequence: CLI and dashboard share a single `write_task_event()` in `lattice.storage.operations`. Dashboard supports `--force` status transitions matching CLI behavior. Non-loopback dashboard binds are read-only by default. All task ID inputs are validated before filesystem operations.

---

## 2026-02-15: Human-friendly short IDs (ULIDs remain canonical)

- Decision: ULIDs (`task_01...`) remain the internal primary key for filenames, events, locks, and relationships. Short IDs (`LAT-42`) are a human-facing alias layer resolved at the CLI boundary.
- Rationale: Changing the canonical ID would require rewriting every event, snapshot, lock, and filename. The alias approach is additive and non-breaking.
- Consequence: All CLI commands accept both ULID and short ID inputs. Short IDs are resolved to ULIDs before any operation.

---

## 2026-02-15: Short ID stored in snapshot and events; index file is derived

- Decision: `short_id` is a first-class field on task snapshots. Included in `task_created` event data. A dedicated `task_short_id_assigned` event handles retroactive assignment. `.lattice/ids.json` is a derived index (rebuildable from events).
- Rationale: Events are authoritative. The index is a read optimization, not a source of truth.
- Consequence: `lattice rebuild --all` regenerates `ids.json`. `lattice doctor` checks alias integrity.

---

## 2026-02-15: Project code in config.json; counter in ids.json

- Decision: `project_code` (1-5 uppercase ASCII letters) stored in `.lattice/config.json`. `next_seq` counter stored in `.lattice/ids.json` alongside the mapping.
- Rationale: Config is the natural place for project-level settings. The counter lives with the mapping it governs.
- Consequence: `lattice init --project-code`, `lattice set-project-code`, and `lattice backfill-ids` manage project code lifecycle.

---

## 2026-02-15: Existing short IDs are immutable

- Decision: Once assigned, a task's short ID never changes — even if the project code is changed later.
- Rationale: References to `LAT-7` in comments, docs, and conversations must remain stable forever.
- Consequence: Changing project code only affects future task creation.

---

## 2026-02-15: Dedicated event type for retroactive short ID assignment

- Decision: `task_short_id_assigned` (not `field_updated`) for migration of existing tasks.
- Rationale: Using `field_updated` would conflict with `short_id` being a protected field. A dedicated event type makes replay semantics explicit.
- Consequence: `short_id` is in PROTECTED_FIELDS and cannot be changed via `lattice update`.

---

## 2026-02-15: Open question — Is "task" the right primitive?

- Status: **Open question**, not a decision. Noted for future exploration.
- Observation: Tasks are the inherited metaphor from project management, but agents may coordinate more naturally around other primitives — goals, invariants, contracts, capabilities. For v0, a "task" can represent any of these. The abstraction may evolve in later versions.
- Consequence: No action now. Revisit when real usage patterns emerge that strain the task metaphor.

---

## 2026-02-15: Fractal instance hierarchy

- Decision: Lattice supports multiple independent instances at different scopes (program → workspace → repo) that form a loose hierarchy. Each instance is self-contained with identical on-disk format and CLI. Coordination between levels is agent-mediated, not system-mediated.
- Rationale: File-based is load-bearing — agents are excellent at filesystem interaction. Multi-machine, multi-project coordination works through git as the sync layer (event-sourced architecture makes merges tractable: events accumulate, snapshots are rebuilt). Keeping instances independent avoids distributed systems complexity; agents provide the intelligence to bridge levels.
- Consequence: Each instance gets an `instance_id` (ULID) and `instance_name` in config. A `context.md` file inside `.lattice/` provides agent-readable context about the instance's role, relationships, and conventions. No automatic sync in v0 — agents read/write across instances manually.

---

## 2026-02-15: Hierarchical short IDs — project-subproject-seq

- Decision: Short IDs support an optional `subproject_code` yielding the format `{project_code}-{subproject_code}-{seq}` (e.g., `AUT-F-7`). When no subproject is set, the existing `{project_code}-{seq}` format is preserved.
- Rationale: The ID becomes a coordinate — project, subproject, task number — readable in conversation, commit messages, and cross-instance references without a lookup table. Matches real organizational structure (e.g., `AUT-F` for frontend, `AUT-B` for backend).
- Consequence: `subproject_code` (1–5 uppercase ASCII, optional) added to config. Existing short IDs are unaffected (backward compatible). Subproject depth is limited to one level — deeper hierarchy uses separate instances, not longer IDs.

---

## 2026-02-15: Agent-readable context file (`.lattice/context.md`)

- Decision: Each `.lattice/` directory may contain a `context.md` — a freeform markdown file describing the instance's purpose, related instances, conventions, and idiosyncrasies. Created by `lattice init` with a minimal template.
- Rationale: Agents read natural language context exceptionally well. A rigid JSON schema for instance relationships would be premature and couldn't express soft knowledge ("infra tasks take 2-3x estimates"). `config.json` stays machine-parseable for the CLI; `context.md` is the agent-facing context layer.
- Consequence: `context.md` is the CLAUDE.md of a Lattice instance. Agents should read it before working with an instance. It is non-authoritative (like notes) — informational, not enforced.

---

## 2026-02-15: Deep Attribution (Provenance) on Events

**Decision:** Add an optional `provenance` field to events as a sibling to the existing `agent_meta` field. Three sub-fields: `triggered_by` (event/task ID or free-form reference), `on_behalf_of` (actor format, validated), and `reason` (free-text). Included only when at least one sub-field is provided. No schema_version bump.

**Context:** Lattice tracks *proximate* attribution (who performed an action) via the required `actor` field. But in agent-orchestrated workflows, the chain of causation matters: who delegated the work, what event triggered it, and why. Without deep attribution, the event log records *what happened* but not *why it happened* or *on whose authority*.

**Rationale:**
- Follows the established `agent_meta` pattern: optional, sparse, invisible when unused.
- No breaking changes. Old events remain valid. Old code reading new events ignores `provenance` (unknown fields are tolerated per schema policy).
- Three CLI flags (`--triggered-by`, `--on-behalf-of`, `--reason`) added to all write commands via `common_options`.
- `on_behalf_of` is validated as actor format for consistency with the `actor` field.

**`--reason` conflict resolution:** The `status` command previously had its own `--reason` flag for forced transitions. This was removed in favor of the `--reason` from `common_options` (param name: `provenance_reason`). When `--force` is used with `--reason`, the reason is written to both `data.reason` (backward compatibility) and `provenance.reason`. When `--reason` is used without `--force`, it goes only to `provenance.reason`. This unifies the reason mechanism across all commands.

**Consequences:**
- Every write command now accepts `--triggered-by`, `--on-behalf-of`, and `--reason`.
- The provenance field appears in the event log (JSONL) and is displayed by `lattice show`.
- MCP tools are not yet updated (follow-up work).
- The Philosophy.md section on attribution has been updated to reflect this capability.

## 2026-02-15: Two primitive pairs — Tickets/Tasks and Panels/Displays

**Decision:** Lattice has two parallel compositional primitives:

1. **Tickets contain Tasks** — the work decomposition primitive. Humans think in tickets (units of concern: "fix auth redirect"). Agents think in tasks (units of execution: "read config, check token, write fix"). This was established in Philosophy.md and is already implemented.

2. **Panels contain Displays** — the information presentation primitive. A Panel is a configurable container that the human sees as a unit on the dashboard. A Display is a content element within a panel — a chart, a stat card, a table, an agent output, a timeline, anything that communicates state to the human. Panels are composable and user-configurable.

**Context:** The dashboard stats page revealed that a fixed layout doesn't scale. Different projects need different views. More importantly, Lattice's role as a common language for human-agent coordination requires a shared visual vocabulary — agents need consistent expectations for how to present information to humans. If every tool invents its own display format, there's no shared norm. Panels and Displays give agents (and other tools building on Lattice) a known target: "build a Display, put it in a Panel, and the human will see it in the expected way."

**Rationale:**
- Mirrors the Tickets/Tasks pair: Panels are the human-altitude view (what do I see?), Displays are the agent-altitude view (what do I render?).
- Open primitive: any agent, skill, or external tool can produce Displays that slot into Panels. This makes the dashboard a composable communication surface, not a hardcoded report.
- Establishes a shared norm across the ecosystem — other tools (OpenClaw skills, MCP servers, etc.) can target the Panel/Display contract and know their output will render consistently.

**Consequences:**
- Dashboard becomes panel-based: users configure which panels appear and what displays they contain.
- Display types are extensible — start with the proven ones (stat cards, charts, tables, timelines) and grow.
- Panel configuration lives in `.lattice/config.json` or a dedicated dashboard config.
- Not yet implemented. This decision captures the architectural direction.

## 2026-02-15: Task graph structure — the backlog is not a flat list

**Decision:** Tasks in the backlog (and other statuses) form a rich directed graph through their blocking/dependency relationships. This graph structure is first-class, not incidental. The system should support both simple list views and richer graph visualizations of the same data simultaneously.

**Context:** A backlog with 30 items may look flat, but many of those items have blocking relationships — task A blocks B, which blocks C and D, which both block E. This structure is critical information that a flat list hides. The relationships already exist in the event log (via `link` commands and `blocks`/`blocked_by` fields), but the dashboard and CLI present them as secondary metadata rather than as the primary structural reality.

**Rationale:**
- Tasks are zones in a graph, not items in a queue. Two tasks in "backlog" may have very different structural positions — one is a root blocker affecting five downstream items, another is a leaf with no dependencies. Treating them the same is information loss.
- The data is already there. Lattice captures `blocks`, `blocked_by`, `related_to`, `subtask_of`, `parent_of` relationships. The decision is to elevate this from "metadata you can query" to "structure the UI makes visible."
- Enables dependency chain risk analysis, bottleneck detection, and critical path visualization — several of the demo page improvements depend on this being treated as first-class.

**Consequences:**
- Dashboard should offer graph/network views alongside list views.
- Stats computations can analyze graph properties: longest chain, most-blocking task, orphan clusters, critical path.
- CLI commands like `lattice list` may gain topology-aware options (e.g., `--tree`, `--critical-path`).
- Not yet implemented. This decision captures the architectural direction.

---

## 2026-02-16: Plugin system via `importlib.metadata` entry points

- Decision: Lattice supports plugins via two `importlib.metadata` entry point groups: `lattice.cli_plugins` (register additional CLI commands) and `lattice.template_blocks` (provide additional CLAUDE.md template sections). Zero new dependencies.
- Rationale: Enables private extensions (e.g., `lattice-fractal`) to layer on additional CLI commands and CLAUDE.md template blocks without forking the core. The public repo is fully useful on its own while Stage 11 Agentics maintains its opinionated workflow layer privately. `importlib.metadata` is stdlib, well-understood, and used by the wider Python packaging ecosystem (pytest, setuptools, etc.).
- Constraints: v0 rejects `position: "replace_base"` for template blocks — plugins can only append, not replace the base template. Plugin load failures are logged to stderr but never crash the host CLI (matching `storage/hooks.py` error-handling pattern). `LATTICE_DEBUG=1` enables full tracebacks.
- Consequence: Consumer packages define entry points in their `pyproject.toml`. The first consumer is `lattice-fractal` (private package). Core codebase requires no changes to support new plugins — they are discovered automatically at runtime.

---

## 2026-02-15: Cube view — 2D-first graph visualization with status-constrained layout

**Decision:** The dashboard's spatial task visualization ("Cube" view) launches as a 2D force-directed graph using the `force-graph` library (~80KB), not the originally-proposed 3D `3d-force-graph` (~600KB). Layout uses explicit status-based X-axis positioning (d3.forceX pinned to workflow status index) with force-directed Y-axis separation, rather than `dagMode('lr')`.

**Context:** Two independent expert reviews of the original 3D plan identified a fundamental flaw: `dagMode('lr')` arranges nodes by graph topology (parent→child edges), not by status. Tasks with no relationships have no DAG position and float freely; tasks in cycles silently fall back to force-directed layout without indication. The plan's mental model — "status as spatial position" — requires explicit coordinate assignment, which dagMode does not provide.

Additional review findings that shaped this decision:
- A ~600KB CDN dependency (the dashboard's first) is disproportionate for v1 and introduces offline/firewall failure modes
- 3D orbit controls are poor on mobile and inaccessible to screen readers
- Small task counts (3-5, Lattice's current sweet spot) look awkward in 3D space
- The Panels/Displays primitive (decided same day) should be the long-term presentation architecture

**Approach:**
- v1: 2D force-graph with status-constrained X layout. Nodes colored by status (reusing `getLaneColor`), sized by priority. Directed edges colored by relationship type.
- v1.5: Optional 3D toggle that lazy-loads 3d-force-graph only when activated
- Long-term: Implement as a Display within the Panel system

**Key design choices:**
- Hover tooltips for quick inspection; single-click selects + shows side panel; double-click navigates to task detail. Users stay in the graph context.
- CDN fallback: graceful degradation message when library fails to load
- ETag-based revision on `/api/graph` for efficient auto-refresh (avoids JSON.stringify of full graph data every 5s)
- Async render generation counter prevents stale renders on rapid navigation

**Panel/Display compatibility:** The Cube is implemented as a standalone tab for now, but its rendering logic (initCubeGraph, updateCubeData, cleanupCube) is encapsulated as a module pattern compatible with future Display wrapping. When the Panel system is built, migrating Cube to a Display should require only wiring the entry/exit/update lifecycle hooks.

**Consequences:**
- Dashboard now has one external CDN dependency (force-graph, ~80KB with defer loading)
- New `/api/graph` endpoint reads full task snapshots; uses ETag for efficient polling
- 3D visualization deferred to v1.5 as a progressive enhancement
- Mobile gets a notice banner; accessibility relies on Board/List views as alternatives

## 2026-02-16: Field Guides and Runsheets — agent-facing operational primitives

**Decision:** Introduce two new convention-based artifacts in `.lattice/`: **Field Guides** (`.lattice/field-guides/<surface>.md`) describe the anatomy of an interaction surface, and **Runsheets** (`.lattice/runsheets/<surface>.md`) describe critical flows through that surface. Both are scoped per non-CLI interaction surface (web UI, iOS app, Android app).

**Context:** When a test agent, demo agent, or monitoring agent needs to operate a visual/interactive surface (browser, iOS simulator, Android emulator), it currently has to explore from scratch — burning tokens on discovery that a previous agent already completed. CLI surfaces don't have this problem (`--help` and CLAUDE.md cover them). The gap is visual surfaces mediated by MCP tools (Claude-in-Chrome, iOS Simulator MCP, Mobile MCP).

**What each primitive is:**
- **Field Guide** = the territory. Surface anatomy: how to connect (which MCP, what URL, launch sequence), what every view/screen contains, what controls exist, known bugs, interaction tips for agents. Relatively stable — changes when the UI changes.
- **Runsheet** = the critical paths. Ordered sequences through the surface that matter, with context on *why* they matter, expected behavior, and what to watch for. Inspired by Maestro-style flow testing but in plain English — the agent *is* the test runner. More operationally volatile than the field guide.

**Key properties:**
- **Agent-generated, agent-consumed.** An agent explores the surface and writes the guide. Future agents read it to bootstrap. Humans can read them too, but they're optimized for agent consumption.
- **Per interaction surface.** A project with a web dashboard and an iOS app gets `dashboard.md` and `ios-app.md` in each directory.
- **Living documents.** Updated when the surface changes. Mutable, not append-only.
- **Convention files, not schema-enforced.** Like `context.md` — no CLI commands, no JSON schema, no validation. Just a known directory and naming convention.
- **Runsheet cross-references its field guide.** The runsheet opens with "Read the field guide first."

**Naming rationale:** "Field Guide" — a reference you take into unfamiliar territory, written by someone who's already explored it. Naturally scoped ("the dashboard field guide"), plain English, not overloaded with existing tech meaning. "Runsheet" — production/broadcast term for ordered sequences of what happens and when, fitting for critical flow descriptions.

**On-disk layout:**
```
.lattice/
  field-guides/
    dashboard.md
    ios-app.md
  runsheets/
    dashboard.md
    ios-app.md
```

**Rationale:**
- Turns exploration tokens into a one-time authoring cost. A Sonnet-class model reading a field guide can do what an Opus model would need 10 minutes of exploration to figure out. That's the economic argument.
- No new infrastructure needed. Uses existing Lattice conventions (markdown files in `.lattice/`, freeform, non-authoritative).
- Separating anatomy (field guide) from flows (runsheet) mirrors the separation between understanding a system and operating it. Different update cadences, different consumers.

**Consequences:**
- `lattice init` should create these directories (future work).
- Agents updating a surface should be prompted to update the field guide (convention, not enforced).
- The first instances (dashboard field guide + runsheet) are written and serve as the template for future surfaces.
- No CLI commands in v0. Field guides and runsheets are direct file edits, like notes.

## 2026-02-16: Three-tier work hierarchy (Epic → Ticket → Task)

**Decision:** Lattice adopts a three-tier organizational hierarchy: **Epics** (strategic intent), **Tickets** (deliverables), and **Tasks** (units of execution). `ticket` is added as a task type. The tiers are connected via `subtask_of` relationships: tasks are subtasks of tickets, tickets are subtasks of epics.

**Context:** Lattice previously had `epic` as a task type but with no special behavior — just a label. Tasks were effectively flat with optional parent-child grouping. In practice, mixed human-agent coordination operates at three distinct altitudes: humans think at the ticket level (what needs to ship and why), agents think at the task level (how to make it happen), and leads/planners think at the epic level (the strategic arc connecting deliverables). Two tiers collapsed these distinct roles; three tiers give each a home.

**Rationale:**
- Each tier has a different job: epics aggregate strategic intent, tickets are the unit of delivery (assignable, branchable, reviewable), tasks are the unit of execution (what an agent picks up and completes).
- The ticket layer is where accountability lives — it's the natural level for branch linking, PR association, and code review.
- Git branches map to tickets, not tasks. A branch serves a deliverable; individual tasks within it are commits or sub-steps.
- The hierarchy uses existing primitives (task types + `subtask_of` relationships) — no new entity types or schema changes required in v0.

**Agnosticism principle:** Lattice is neutral about how teams use these tiers. The hierarchy is available, not imposed. Some teams will use all three tiers. Some will use flat tasks. The event log records what happened regardless of organizational choice. The primitives are unopinionated; the documentation offers the three-tier model as a current design belief, intended to evolve.

**Consequences:**
- `ticket` added to the default `task_types` list in config.
- Philosophy v3 and User Guide updated to describe the hierarchy.
- This is a convention change (Option 1), not a first-class entity change (Option 2). If the convention proves stable, promotion to distinct entity types with dedicated behavior is a future option.

## 2026-02-17: Remove ticket-task dichotomy — simplify to just tasks

**Decision:** Remove `ticket` as a task type. The board shows tasks. Epics remain as a grouping level. The three-tier hierarchy (epic → ticket → task) is replaced by a simpler two-tier model (epic → task).

**Context:** The three-tier hierarchy was introduced on 2026-02-16 as a convention. In practice, the distinction between "ticket" (deliverable) and "task" (execution unit) added conceptual overhead without clear value at the current scale. The core system was already type-agnostic — "ticket" was just another value of the `type` field with no special behavior in business logic. The dashboard rendered tickets as a distinct visual tier, but this complexity wasn't earning its keep.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler mental model: it's a board with tasks on it. That's the whole thing.
- Removes a layer of abstraction that hadn't proven necessary.
- Epics still provide grouping for strategic initiatives.
- The `subtask_of` relationship still supports hierarchy when needed — tasks can be subtasks of other tasks or of epics.

**Consequences:**
- `ticket` removed from default `task_types` in config.
- Dashboard web view simplified from 3-tier to 2-tier rendering.
- Docs, user guide, philosophy updated.
- Existing tasks with `type: "ticket"` in other Lattice instances will still render (type field is preserved), but new instances won't offer it as a default option.
- Supersedes the 2026-02-16 three-tier hierarchy decision.

## 2026-02-16: Indra's Web — coordination visualization and branch-to-task linking

**Decision:** Add a **Web** tab to the Lattice dashboard that visualizes the cross-repo coordination landscape. Lattice owns the link between branches and tasks via new `branch_linked` / `branch_unlinked` event types. The relationship is many-to-many.

**Context:** Existing dashboard views (Board, List, Activity, Cube) show task state and task relationships. None shows the coordination landscape — where agents are actively working across repos and branches, which deliverables have code moving, and which are stalled. This is the gap between "what depends on what?" (Cube) and "where is work happening right now?" (Web).

**The name:** Indra's Net — the Buddhist/Hindu image of an infinite web where every jewel reflects every other jewel. In a multi-repo, multi-agent system, repos genuinely reflect each other: changes in shared libraries ripple into consumers. Dependencies are the web.

**Visual model:**
- **Hubs** are epics (or repos, depending on the view mode). Central nodes from which work radiates.
- **Spokes** are tickets with linked branches. Each spoke represents a deliverable.
- **Dots** are tasks and commits along each spoke. As agents commit, dots appear at the growing tip.
- **Activity colors:** Yellow = recent git commit (~10 min). Orange = Lattice `in_progress`. Yellow-orange = both.
- **Spoke lifecycle:** When a branch merges and the ticket is marked `done`, the spoke retracts back into the hub.

**Two data layers:** Lattice provides the web's *structure* (task hierarchy, statuses, assignments). Git provides the *vital signs* (branch existence, commit recency, authorship). Together they surface signals neither provides alone: untracked branches (no Lattice task), stuck agents (task active but no commits), completed work (task done + branch merged).

**Branch-to-task linking:**
- Lattice owns the link as coordination state. `branch_linked` events are traceable, attributed, permanent.
- **Cardinality:** Many-to-many. A ticket can link to branches in multiple repos. Multiple tickets can converge on one integration branch.
- **Implicit (convention):** Branch names containing the task's short ID or slug (e.g., `feat/LAT-47-oauth`) are auto-detected as 1:1 links. Zero ceremony for the common case.
- **Explicit (authoritative):** `lattice link <task> --branch <branch-name>` for M:N relationships and cross-repo links.
- **Repo scoping:** `repo` field is nullable. `null` means the local repo. Cross-repo references are future work.

**Design principles:**
- Lattice-primary: the topology comes from Lattice, not git. This is a Lattice visualization enriched with git data, not a git visualization annotated with Lattice.
- Agnostic: renders whatever structure exists. No assumptions about how many tiers a team uses.
- Live: animates as work happens. Watching the web is watching agents work.
- Orphan detection: branches without Lattice tasks are surfaced as untracked work — a coordination failure made visible.

**Consequences:**
- New event types: `branch_linked`, `branch_unlinked` (fields: `branch`, `repo`).
- Dashboard gains a fifth tab (Web) after Board, List, Activity, Cube.
- Git integration in the dashboard (reading branch/commit data) is a prerequisite.
- Full design captured in `FutureFeatures.md`.

## 2026-02-16: `needs_human` as first-class workflow status

- Decision: Add `needs_human` as a distinct status, separate from `blocked`.
- Rationale: Agents need a clear signal for "I'm stuck on *you*" vs. generic external dependencies. `blocked` is ambiguous — it could be a CI failure, a dependency release, or a human decision. `needs_human` creates an explicit queue of "things waiting on the human" that can be scanned and acted on immediately.
- Transitions TO `needs_human`: from `in_planning`, `planned`, `in_progress`, `review` (any active state).
- Transitions FROM `needs_human`: to `in_planning`, `planned`, `in_progress`, `review`, `cancelled`.
- NOT reachable from `backlog` (work hasn't started) or `done`/`cancelled` (terminal).
- Convention: a `lattice comment` explaining what's needed is mandatory when moving to `needs_human`.
- Consequence: Weather reports show `[HUMAN]` attention items. Dashboard uses amber/orange for visual distinction from red `blocked`. The CLAUDE.md template includes a "When You're Stuck" section teaching agents when and how to signal.

---

## 2026-02-16: `lattice next` — pure selection for agent task picking

- Decision: Add `lattice next` as a read-only query command (with optional `--claim` for atomic assignment).
- Rationale: Agents need a deterministic, priority-aware way to pick the next task. Manual `lattice list | sort | filter` is error-prone and duplicated across every agent prompt. A single command with well-defined ordering prevents divergent task-picking logic.
- Algorithm: (1) Resume-first — if `--actor` specified, return in_progress/in_planning tasks assigned to that actor. (2) Pick from ready pool — backlog/planned, unassigned or assigned to requesting actor. (3) Sort by priority → urgency → ULID (oldest first).
- `--claim` atomically assigns the task to the actor and moves it to `in_progress` (two events under one lock). Requires `--actor`.
- Pure logic lives in `core/next.py` (no I/O). CLI wiring in `cli/query_cmds.py`. Weather `_find_up_next` delegates to the same sort logic.
- Consequence: Enables the advance pattern — claim a task, work it, transition it, report. The `/lattice-advance` skill builds on this primitive.

---

## 2026-02-16: Resources — First-class coordination primitive

- Decision: Add a `resource` entity type to Lattice for coordinating exclusive access to shared capabilities (browsers, simulators, MCP tools).
- Rationale: Parallel agents need exclusive access to singleton resources. Without coordination, agents step on each other. Meanwhile, field-guides and runsheets existed as disconnected conventions. Resources unify three concerns: **knowledge** (field-guide.md), **operations** (runsheet.md), and **coordination** (lock state via resource.json) under a single `.lattice/resources/<name>/` directory.
- Event types: 6 new resource event types (`resource_created`, `resource_acquired`, `resource_released`, `resource_heartbeat`, `resource_expired`, `resource_updated`). These use `resource_id` (prefix `res_`) instead of `task_id`.
- TTL mechanism: Evaluated at read time (no daemon). Every resource operation checks if `holder.expires_at < now`. Stale holders are evicted with `resource_expired` events before the requested operation proceeds. Heartbeat extends TTL.
- Auto-create from config: Resources declared in `config.json` under `resources` key are auto-created on first `acquire` — zero ceremony for well-known resources.
- Migration: `.lattice/field-guides/` and `.lattice/runsheets/` directories move into `.lattice/resources/<name>/` as `field-guide.md` and `runsheet.md` respectively.
- CLI: `lattice resource {create|acquire|release|heartbeat|status|list}`. Acquire supports `--wait` (polling with backoff), `--force` (evict current holder), `--task` (link to LAT-*).
- Rebuild/doctor: `lattice rebuild --all` replays `events/res_*.jsonl` to regenerate resource snapshots. `lattice doctor` checks resource snapshot drift and reports stale holders.
- Consequence: Agents can now safely coordinate access to shared resources. The semantic separation of `field-guide.md` (what is it), `runsheet.md` (how to use it), and `resource.json` (who holds it) gives each resource a complete knowledge + coordination package.

## 2026-02-17: Lattice Agent is an external orchestrator, not a Lattice feature

- Decision: The "Lattice Agent" — a persistent, board-level orchestrator that triages, assigns, and makes strategic decisions across the whole board — is explicitly **not** a Lattice feature. It is an external usage pattern. Lattice's automation ceiling is **Workers**.
- Context: The Workers design doc (LAT-93) described three tiers: Hooks (lightweight reactions), Workers (task-scoped heavyweight automation), and a "Lattice Agent" (board-scoped orchestrator). The Agent row was aspirational — describing what an intelligent consumer of the Lattice CLI looks like, not a feature to build into Lattice itself.
- Rationale: Lattice is coordination infrastructure, not the coordinator. The board-level intelligence that decides what to work on, who to assign, and when to escalate is fundamentally an LLM-powered judgment call — it belongs in the orchestration layer (a Claude Code session, an advance skill, a custom script) that drives the CLI. Different teams want radically different orchestration logic; baking one into Lattice would either be too opinionated or too generic. Keeping the boundary clean means Lattice stays a shippable, portable primitive.
- Consequence: No `lattice agent` command. Workers (`lattice worker run/list/ps`) are the highest-level automation Lattice owns. The dispatcher (`lattice worker watch`, Phase 3 of Workers) is mechanical rule-matching, not intelligent orchestration. Board-level intelligence lives at the Stage 11 Agentics / consumer layer — e.g., `/lattice-advance`, custom orchestrator scripts, or future products built on top of Lattice.

## 2026-02-17: Epics as derived-status bottom-lane containers

**Decision:** Epics should not flow through the Kanban workflow like leaf tasks. Their status is derived from subtask completion, and they display as a persistent bottom lane on the dashboard rather than in status columns.

**Context:** LAT-26 (Open Source Launch epic) exposed the mismatch: manually setting an epic to `in_progress` doesn't mean the same thing as a leaf task in `in_progress`. Epics are grouping containers whose "status" is really a progress ratio. Forcing them through the same workflow transitions as leaf tasks (including needing `--force` to skip steps) is friction without value.

**Design:**
- Epics display as a persistent bottom lane on the Board view, not in Kanban status columns
- Epic status is computed from subtask completion (e.g., 6/9 done) — no manual status transitions
- Rich information across three key dashboard surfaces:
  - **Board** — bottom lane with progress bars, health indicators, subtask counts
  - **Cube** — epic nodes rendered distinctly in the 3D relationship graph, with subtask clustering visible
  - **Web** — epic detail with full timeline, subtask breakdown, bottleneck visibility
- Epics reflect — they don't move. The Board columns above answer "what do I do next"; the bottom lane answers "how are my initiatives going"

**Consequence:** Requires dashboard changes (Board bottom lane rendering, Cube epic node styling, Web epic detail), CLI changes (`lattice show` for epics renders differently), and core changes (derived status computation). Tracked as LAT-103.

---

## 2026-02-17: Workers and trigger automation removed from Lattice (LAT-108)

**Decision:** Remove all worker/trigger automation from Lattice. Lattice is data and coordination primitives, not intelligence. External agents (`/lattice-advance`, OpenClaw, Claude Code) decide what to do with Lattice data.

**Context:** The Workers design (LAT-93) added `lattice worker run/list/ps/complete/fail`, process event types (`process_started`, `process_completed`, `process_failed`), `active_processes` snapshot tracking, dashboard trigger modal, and workers badge/panel. In practice, the intelligence that decides *when* and *how* to act on status changes belongs in the orchestration layer — not baked into Lattice's event pipeline. Easier to add fresh than maintain dead code.

**Supersedes:** The 2026-02-17 entry "Lattice Agent is an external orchestrator, not a Lattice feature" stated Workers were the automation ceiling. That ceiling has been removed entirely. Hooks (general-purpose shell commands on status transitions) remain as the only built-in automation.

**What was removed:** `worker_cmds.py` (CLI), worker JSON definitions, process event types, `active_processes` snapshot field, dashboard trigger modal, workers badge/panel, all worker/trigger API endpoints, worker-specific tests and design docs.

**What was kept:** `storage/hooks.py` (general-purpose hook execution), `hooks.transitions` config structure, all other event types.

**Consequence:** No `lattice worker` command. No process events. No trigger UI. Hooks are the only built-in automation primitive. All higher-level automation lives in external agents.

---

## 2026-02-17: Branch auto-detection by short code (LAT-115)

**Decision:** Implement auto-detection of branch-task links when a git branch name contains a task's short code (e.g., `feat/LAT-42-login` auto-links to LAT-42). Display these as `(auto-detected)` in `lattice show` alongside explicit branch links.

**Context:** The `branch-link`/`branch-unlink` commands existed but no agents used them because the CLAUDE.md workflow instructions didn't mention them. Two gaps: (A) no guidance telling agents to run `lattice branch-link` when creating feature branches, and (B) no automatic detection for the common convention of embedding short codes in branch names.

**Matching rules:** Short code extraction uses regex with non-alpha boundaries (`(?<![A-Za-z])LAT-42(?![A-Za-z])`) to prevent `LAT-4` from matching inside `LAT-42`. Case-insensitive. Strips common prefixes like `feat/`, `fix/` by nature of the boundary matching. Implemented in `core/ids.extract_short_ids()` (shared by CLI and dashboard JS).

**Display:** Auto-detected branches appear in `lattice show` with `(auto-detected)` suffix. Once a branch is explicitly linked via `branch-link`, it no longer appears as auto-detected (deduplication). JSON output includes an `auto_detected_branches` array.

**Scope:** Auto-detection scans all local git branches on `lattice show` only (not `list`, which would be too expensive). The dashboard already had its own JS-side auto-detection which was updated to use consistent boundary matching.

**Consequence:** CLAUDE.md template and project CLAUDE.md updated with "Branch Linking" section. Agents now have explicit guidance to run `branch-link` when creating feature branches.

---

## 2026-02-18: Completion policy errors now suggest satisfaction, not just bypass

**Decision:** Changed completion policy error messages from `"Missing role: review. Use --force --reason to override."` to `"Missing role: review. Satisfy with: lattice attach --role review or lattice comment --role review. Override with --force --reason."` The error now tells agents how to satisfy the policy (the right thing) before telling them how to bypass it.

**Context:** Agents encountering the old message would often `--force --reason` past the policy because that was the only action the error suggested. The policy exists to ensure reviews actually happen, so the primary guidance should be how to fulfill it.

**Consequence:** Error code `COMPLETION_BLOCKED` is unchanged and stable. Agents or scripts matching on the human-readable message text (not the error code) will see different strings. The error code is the stable contract; message text is for human/agent comprehension.

---

## 2026-02-18: SIGHUP-based dashboard restart

**Decision:** The dashboard now handles SIGHUP as a graceful restart signal. A new `lattice restart --port PORT` command finds the process on the given port and sends SIGHUP.

**Context:** The dashboard runs as a foreground process in a dedicated terminal window. When agents make changes that require a dashboard reset (config changes, schema updates, static asset changes), the human previously had to manually Ctrl+C and re-run `lattice dashboard`. Agents couldn't trigger this themselves.

**Alternatives considered:**
- External wrapper script: works but lives outside the CLI, easy to lose track of.
- Process manager / supervisor: too heavy for a local dev tool. Violates the "no process management" non-goal.
- File watcher with auto-reload: adds a dependency and complexity for something that happens infrequently.

**Implementation:** `serve_forever()` runs in a while loop. SIGHUP handler sets a flag and triggers shutdown (signal-handler safe — sets `_BaseServer__shutdown_request` directly to avoid deadlock from `shutdown()`'s internal `wait()`). After `serve_forever()` returns, the loop checks the flag: restart on SIGHUP, exit on anything else. `lattice restart` uses `lsof -ti:PORT` to find the PID and `os.kill(pid, SIGHUP)` to send the signal.

**Consequence:** Unix-only (SIGHUP doesn't exist on Windows). Acceptable — the dashboard is a local dev tool and the primary audience is macOS/Linux.

---

## 2026-02-18: Unify artifact_refs and comment_role_refs into evidence_refs (LAT-146)

**Decision:** Replace two parallel `[{id, role}]` fields (`artifact_refs` and `comment_role_refs`) with a single `evidence_refs` field that carries a `source_type` discriminator (`"artifact"` or `"comment"`). Clean break — new snapshots no longer produce the old fields.

**Context:** Both fields served the same purpose: tracking evidence items with roles for completion policy validation. Having two separate fields meant two loops in policy checks, two sets of protected fields, and two code paths for every consumer. The structures were identical (`{id, role}`), differing only in source.

**Schema:** `evidence_refs: [{id: str, role: str|None, source_type: "artifact"|"comment"}, ...]`

**Backward compatibility:** `get_artifact_roles()`, `get_comment_role_refs()`, and all consumers check for `evidence_refs` first, falling back to the legacy field names for old snapshots that haven't been rebuilt. `rebuild --all` produces snapshots with only `evidence_refs`.

**Consequence:** Completion policy validation uses a single `get_evidence_roles()` function. Future evidence types (e.g., `ci_result`, `external_review`) can be added by extending `source_type` without new snapshot fields.

---

## 2026-02-18: Mandatory planning and context-window separation (Two-Phase Advance)

**Decision:** Every task must have a substantive plan file before execution begins — no exceptions. Planning and execution are separate phases that should happen in separate agent context windows. `lattice advance N` is replaced by single-task invocations where each task is executed in a fresh subprocess/subagent.

**Context:** In practice, `lattice advance` was skipping the planning phase. Two root causes:

1. **Mechanical:** `lattice next --claim` uses BFS (`compute_claim_transitions`) to find the shortest path from `backlog` to `in_progress`. The shortest path is `backlog → planned → in_progress` (2 hops), which bypasses `in_planning` entirely because `backlog → in_planning → planned → in_progress` is 3 hops.

2. **Prompt-level:** The advance skill said "For trivial tasks where the description fully specifies the work, skip this and go straight to implementation." Agents under time pressure classified nearly everything as trivial.

Additionally, `lattice advance N` processed multiple tasks in a single context window. By task 3-4, the context was full of irrelevant code, test output, and review comments from earlier tasks — degrading quality.

**The philosophical insight:** Planning and execution are fundamentally different cognitive modes. Planning requires *breadth* (reading widely, weighing tradeoffs). Execution requires *depth* (focused implementation of a specific approach). Mixing them in one context window means the executing agent carries exploratory residue that dilutes its focus. Separating them creates a forcing function: the plan file must be good enough for a completely different mind to execute, because it *will be* a different mind.

**Three principles:**

1. **Mandatory planning.** Every task gets a plan file before execution begins. For trivial tasks, a one-line plan is fine ("Fix the typo on line 77 of `src/foo.py`"). But the plan must exist, because it's the handoff contract between the planning mind and the executing mind.

2. **One task, one context window.** Each task's execution happens in a fresh subprocess/subagent. The parent agent is a thin orchestrator — it claims tasks, dispatches work, and records results. It never enters "developer mode." This ensures task 5 gets the same quality as task 1.

3. **The plan file is the bridge.** It's the only artifact that crosses the context-window boundary. This elevates it from optional documentation to load-bearing coordination primitive. A bad plan = a confused executing agent.

**Implementation — code-level enforcement:**

- `lattice status <task> in_progress` rejects the transition if the plan file is scaffold-only. Clear error: "Plan is still scaffold. Write the plan first, or use `--force --reason`."
- `lattice next --claim` (which targets `in_progress`) inherits the same gate.
- The existing `_is_scaffold_plan_content()` function provides the detection logic.
- `--force --reason` remains available for genuinely exceptional cases.

**Implementation — skill/prompt changes:**

- `/lattice-advance` becomes single-task: removes multi-advance counter, meta-learning pass, and "trivial task skip" language.
- The advance skill spawns a subtask (fresh context window) for execution, passing only the task ID and plan file path.
- Planning can also be a subtask: the orchestrator spawns a planning agent that writes the plan, then spawns an execution agent that implements it.

**What this changes about `--claim`:**

- `--claim` still works mechanically (assign + transition), but it can no longer reach `in_progress` if the plan is scaffold.
- For Phase 1 (planning), claim target should be `in_planning`.
- For Phase 2 (execution), claim from `planned` → `in_progress` (single valid hop, no BFS needed, but plan must be substantive).

**Supersedes:** The 2026-02-16 `lattice next` decision's description of `--claim` atomically moving to `in_progress` is now gated by plan validation. The escape hatch in the advance skill ("for trivial tasks, skip planning") is removed.

**Consequences:**
- All CLAUDE.md files with Lattice workflow instructions must remove "skip planning" language.
- The advance skill is rewritten for single-task, two-phase operation.
- `query_cmds.py` and `task_cmds.py` gain plan-validation gates on `in_progress` transitions.
- New tests for plan validation enforcement.
- `needs-human-and-next-guide.md` updated to describe the two-phase model.

---

## 2026-02-18: Auto-detect task commits in `lattice show` (LAT-144)

**Decision:** `lattice show` now performs read-only git commit discovery by task short code. When a task has a short ID (for example `LAT-144`), show runs `git log --grep=<short_id>` and renders matches in a `Commits:` section. JSON output includes `auto_detected_commits` when matches are found.

**Context:** Lattice previously tracked explicit branch links but had no visibility into the commit trail associated with a task. Commit references already exist by convention in commit messages, so runtime detection provides useful context without adding write-time ceremony or schema/event churn.

**Alternatives considered:**
- New event type for commit linkage: rejected because commits are external VCS state and would introduce stale write-time data plus event-model complexity.
- Manual command to attach commit IDs: rejected as agent/human overhead for information already derivable from git history.
- Always scan all refs with `--all`: rejected for now to keep behavior aligned with the explicit `git log --grep=<short_id>` intent and limit read cost.

**Consequence:** `lattice show` gains an additive read-only section and optional JSON field, while continuing to degrade gracefully when git is unavailable or when the directory is not a git repository. No new events or persisted snapshot fields are introduced.

---

## 2026-02-18: Actor identity is a structured primitive (LAT-160)

- **Decision:** Actor identity is now a structured dict (name, base_name, serial, session, model, framework, etc.) stored directly in the event `actor` field. The `model` field doubles as type indicator: `model: "human"` = human, anything else = agent. `--name` replaces `--actor` as the primary identity flag; `--actor` is deprecated but still accepted.
- **Rationale:** Free-form `prefix:identifier` strings couldn't distinguish two runtimes of the same model (e.g., two Claude Code tabs both using `agent:claude-cli`). This caused concurrent task claims and branch collisions. Structured identity with session ULIDs makes every runtime unique.
- **Consequence:** Events store either a legacy string or a structured dict in `actor`. All comparison logic uses `get_actor_display()` for compatibility. Session state lives in `.lattice/sessions/`. Serial counters are append-only and never recycle. Plan files (`.lattice/plans/`) are the canonical home for per-task design decisions.

---

## 2026-02-18: Plan file is the core traveling document for a task

- **Decision:** The plan file (`.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md`) is the canonical home for all task-level context: scope, design decisions, acceptance criteria, and rationale. Design decisions that are scoped to a single task belong in the plan file, not in `Decisions.md`.
- **Rationale:** The plan file is linked by task ID, travels with the task through archive, and is what agents read when picking up work. Scattering task-level decisions across `Decisions.md` dilutes both documents.
- **Consequence:** `Decisions.md` is reserved for cross-cutting architectural decisions that affect the system as a whole. Plan scaffolding is intentionally minimal (title + description only) — the planning agent writes whatever structure the task needs.

---

## 44. Remove epic task type (LAT-171)

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Epics were redundant with the subtask_of relationship system and created lifecycle management overhead (zombie epics that nobody closes).
**Decision:** Remove `type: epic` entirely. Grouping is handled by subtask_of relationships. The web visualization uses topology-based "hub" detection (nodes with children but no parent) instead of checking for epic type.
**Consequences:** Existing epics in live instances will retain their type field in event history but the type value will no longer be validated as a known type. New task creation will reject "epic" as a type.

---

## 2026-04-19: Layer-boundary exception in core/agent_spawn.py (LAT-205)

- **Context:** LAT-205 carved a backend-pluggable agent spawning primitive out of `core/review.py`. The new module `core/agent_spawn.py` ships the public contract (`SpawnRequest`, `SpawnResult`, `Backend` ABC, `spawn_one`, `spawn_many`) plus the env-aware `select_backend()` selector. The CLAUDE.md layer rule says `core/` is pure business logic with no filesystem calls.
- **Decision:** Keep `select_backend()` in `core/agent_spawn.py` as an acknowledged exception. The selector instantiates concrete backends (`HeadlessBackend` from `storage/`, `CmuxBackend` / `TerminalBackend` from `integrations/`), which forces a `core → storage` and `core → integrations` import direction the layer model normally forbids. Splitting the selector into `storage/agent_spawn.py` would either invert the *type* contract (storage owning the ABC) or introduce a registry/factory in `core/` that does the same instantiation indirectly. The `HeadlessBackend` itself, plus the polling helper, do live in `storage/agent_spawn.py` — that piece of the split was tractable.
- **Rationale:** Pre-existing `core/review.py` already runs subprocesses and writes review state to disk; the new primitive is a successor to that pattern, not an escalation of it. The existing layer rule was already de-facto bent for the same reason. Formalizing the exception in writing beats hiding it.
- **Consequence:** Follow-up Lattice task tracks rectifying the import direction (e.g., introducing a registry pattern or moving the selector entirely). Until that lands, treat `core/agent_spawn.py`'s I/O surface (env-var reads, `shutil.which`, best-effort `cmux identify`) as the documented exception, not precedent for further drift.

## Note: This file is append-only

`Decisions.md` is an append-only log. Entries are never edited or deleted after recording. Superseded decisions are noted inline with a reference to the superseding entry. Cross-cutting architectural decisions go here; task-scoped design decisions belong in the plan file (`.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md`).
