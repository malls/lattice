    record names a parent that auto-fired this review (``auto_fired=True``
    AND ``started_by_pid == os.getppid()``) and ``--triggered-by`` was
    set, write a new record directly with ``auto_fired=True`` and our PID
    — bypassing the live-other-PID refusal that would otherwise fire,
    because the "other" PID is our spawning parent.

    Otherwise call ``claim_review_state(...)``: the standard stale-PID
    reclaim handles the typical case (parent exited before child reached
    this point), and the live-other-PID refusal handles real contention.
    ``auto_fired`` carries over from ``--triggered-by``, which only the
    auto-fire path ever passes — the adoption branch above depends on the
    parent still being alive, which it usually is not by the time the
    detached child gets here, so without this the record claimed that no
    review on the board was ever auto-fired.

    Logs the friendly "review already in flight" message and exits 1
